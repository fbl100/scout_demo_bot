# Marvin The Discord Bot
This is the source code for Marvin the discord robot.

These are the meeting slides:

To run this robot, you will need to create your own discord server and generate a bot token.  Both
are free, but require your parent's permission.

The best way to get started programming is to jump in and try stuff.  Discord bots are a fun
way to experiment, while learning new skills at the same time.  I highly recommend starting 
with the guide at https://discordjs.guide/.  I have found that Visual Studio code works well for 
both Javascript and Python.  This project is in Javascript.

If you would like to modify Marvin as part of the programming merit badge, feel free.  I am willing
to work with you to get your environment setup.

To run marvin on your local machine (after you have installed node.js), you need to install two extra packages.  Do this by typing

```
npm install discord.js
npm install fs
```

once you have done that, you should be able to run
```
node bot.js
```
